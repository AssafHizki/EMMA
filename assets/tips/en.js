        text: "The process, follow up and tracking the ovulatory window by using vaginal ultrasound can be perceived as invasive and hard to bear. Abdominal ultrasound can definitely make your experience much better. How is it done? All you need to do is to arrive to the exam with a full bladder. If youâ€™re scheduled first thing on the morning - avoid using the toilet when you wake up. If later during the day - you may drink 1 liter of water 1 hour before the exam. That should get your bladder ready. Good luck!"

        text: "\"Injectables?! Sounds scary!\" Moving to the next step in fertility treatments- injectable hormones, is a difficult step. Injecting to oneself may seem like an impossible mission, but with the right technique and some guidance it can become simple. A fertility nurse can help with the first guidance as well as videos created by the company who produces the drug you aim to use.\n" +
            "Another tip from us: the insertion of the needle should be very quick, one shot. But the delivery of the drug when you push the vial should be done slowly, letting the material spread and thus avoiding pain from the drug."

        text: "IVF - In Vitro Fertilization - is a procedure used to extract eggs from the female body, fertilize them in a dish and then grow the fertilized egg into embryos for 3 to 5 days. Afterwards the embryos can be transferred back to the uterus or be kept frozen for months and years. The procedure is highly successful in treating certain fertility problems. The success rates of the procedure are 11%-40%, depending on the infertility cause, age of the eggs and other parameters."

        text: "IUI - Intrauterine Insemination - is a procedure that helps to bring sperm straight into the uterus. The sperm is first washed of its proteins, and afterwards injected through a thin catheter straight into the uterus. Then it's up to nature to do its magic! The sperm will climb up to the fallopian tubes, where it will meet an egg and hopefully fertilize it. Success rates of the procedure are 8%-20% per cycle."
