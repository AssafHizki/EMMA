        text: "The process, follow up and tracking the ovulatory window by using vaginal ultrasound can be perceived as invasive and hard to bear. Abdominal ultrasound can definitely make your experience much better. How is it done? All you need to do is to arrive to the exam with a full bladder. If youâ€™re scheduled first thing on the morning - avoid using the toilet when you wake up. If later during the day - you may drink 1 liter of water 1 hour before the exam. That should get your bladder ready. Good luck!"

        text: "\"Injectables?! Sounds scary!\" Moving to the next step in fertility treatments- injectable hormones, is a difficult step. Injecting to oneself may seem like an impossible mission, but with the right technique and some guidance it can become simple. A fertility nurse can help with the first guidance as well as videos created by the company who produces the drug you aim to use.\n" +
            "Another tip from us: the insertion of the needle should be very quick, one shot. But the delivery of the drug when you push the vial should be done slowly, letting the material spread and thus avoiding pain from the drug."
